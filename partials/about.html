<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Non-Inferiority Sample Size Calculator (NISSC) is a free web-based sample size calculator not only for non-inferiority studies but also for superiority trials with continuous, binary, and survival outcomes. It is an open-source web application available on <a href="https://nissc.github.io/NISSC">GitHub</a> and does not require downloads or installations.</p>
<p>A non-inferiority design is considered when we desire to show that the experimental treatment is shown to have similar effect, yet is less costly, better in terms of safety, and/or more convenient to administer than the active control.</p>
<p>The general hypotheses are</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> The experimental treatment is inferior to the standard treatment by more than a pre-determined margin.</p>
    <p><strong>H<sub>a</sub>:</strong> The experimental treatment is either better than the standard treatment or the experimental treatment is inferior to the standard treatment by less than a pre-determined margin.</p>

<p>The non-inferiority margin is the smallest difference that is clinically meaningful or the largest difference that is clinically meaningless.</p>
